Answers

1. True: `ls` is indeed used to list files and directories in a directory.
2. True: `mv` is used to move files and directories.
3. False: `cd` is used to change directories, not to copy files and directories.
4. True: `pwd` does stand for "print working directory" and displays the current directory.
5. True: `grep` is used to search for patterns in files.
6. True: `chmod 755 file.txt` indeed gives read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to the group and others.
7. True: `mkdir -p directory1/directory2` creates nested directories, creating `directory2` inside `directory1` if `directory1` does not exist.
8. True: `rm -rf file.txt` deletes a file forcefully without confirmation.
